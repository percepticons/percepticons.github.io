                <p style="text-align: justify;"> At the stage where human is surrounded by the technology, we're still not sure what
                    we're dealing with. And so is about AI, we're constantly working and moving positively in the direction
                    where we can make a machine with intelligence and common sense as human. Although it is never been
                    an easy task to make machines learn, but for machines it is quite easy and so we're doing,
                    making machines that can learn by experiences as human do.
                    And that's Machine Learning. Using ML the machines can generate an algorithm to work
                    by the examples and experiences like 'Alpha Go', which observed and played millions of games
                    to build a perfect algorithm to play the Chinese game GO.
                    AI is not about Robots, robot are nothing but a programmed machine. There are many other
                    things in world of AI. We're connected to AI more than we realize, making machines 
                    capable to use language makes easy to communicate with them like Google Assistant or Siri. 
                    Generally, we think that AI is new to the World, but that's not true. AI is been in the market 
                    since last 60 years, however it is one of the most used term since last 3-4 years and so it seems to be new. AI can 
                    help human to complete their task in much lesser time with more accuracy and perfection.
                    And to be reminded, we've accomplished much more in the world of AI than it seems.
                    So as it is said, "its not Human VS Machine, its Human and Machine VS Problem".</p>

                <p style="text-align: justify;">Machine Learning is an approach to create Artificial Intelligence. Learning in machine learning is defined
                    as the acquisition of knowledge or skills through experience.

                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    Learning refers to gain new understanding, knowledge, values, etc.
                    Like a child learn by watching surroundings. The same goes for computers when we teach some specific tasks to do after teaching them what they have to do.
                    We use some pre-existing data to teach them and expect to give results of the same field when we give inputs.

                <p style="text-align: justify;">Deep Learning is a name given to Artificial Neural Network (ANN).
                    ANN simulates the structure and working of the human brain. 
                    Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning which aims to solve
                     complex tasks that machine learning cannot do. DL has a separate
                     set of algorithms to implement on a wide range of problems.
                     Comparatively, DL requires more computation power to achieve its goal. 
                    DL works with a lot of data, usually millions of data.</p>
